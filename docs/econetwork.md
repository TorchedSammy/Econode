# Econetwork
The Econetwork is the name of an Econode server. It's the network of other Econodes
competing with each other to gain the most amount of money.

This document is for miscellaneous details about implementing them and anything
related to Econetworks.

# Authorization
A client can be authorized to do activities in the Econetwork by logging in or registering.
On initial registration, a user should not be in any Econode. They'll chose to either
join an existing one or start their own.

# Commands
Since the Econode client was meant to be in a terminal-style interface, interacting
with the Econetwork is done with commands. A lot of these command names are also the
method names.

# Econodes
Econodes are what make up the Econetwork. A stable and thriving Econetwork is one with
lots of competing Econodes earning high amounts of money.

### Creating/Removing an Econode
When a user creates an Econode, it will be given $4,000 as starting cash.
Removing an Econode from the Econetwork has a baseline cost of $8,000 that increases
while the node's worth increases.
