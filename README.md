this was stupid
if anyone thinks something else, joins the server and actually say something to maybe revive the project

Join my Discord at https://discord.gg/3PDdcQz  

Econode is an idle incremental game (think like Cookie Clicker,
or the [Cafe Discord bot](https://twitter.com/cafediscordbot?))
implemented as a Server to Client game where you compete with others in the Econetwork
(Econode server) to have the highest earning Econode.

> âš  Econode is mostly in the concepting/alpha stage right now. Beware!  
This means that things like the database format, Go API and protocol will change A LOT.

# Setup
For testing, you can run an Econode server.
To build the server, just run `go build ./cmd/econode-server`

# Documentation
Econode has documention for several things: its Websocket protocol, formulas and item
prices.

They are located in the [`docs`](docs/) folder.  
There is NO GUARANTEED STABILITY for ANY documents currently.

# License
The reference Econode server and client implementations are licensed under the MIT license.
