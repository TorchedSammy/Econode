Join my Discord at https://discord.gg/3PDdcQz  

Econode is an idle incremental game (think like Cookie Clicker,
or the [Cafe Discord bot](https://twitter.com/cafediscordbot?))
implemented as a Server to Client game where you compete with others in the Econetwork
(Econode server) to have the highest earning Econode.

‚ö†Ô∏è Econode is mostly in the concepting stage right now. Beware!  
More info, and install instructions to setup an Econetwork will come soon.

# Goals and/or Features
- Fun during development
- Multiplayer (both in competing with others and working together for a single node)

# Documentation
Econode has documention for several things: its Websocket protocol, formulas and item
prices.

They are located in the [`docs`](docs/) folder.  
There is NO GUARANTEED STABILITY of ANY documents currently,
as Econode is in a pretty fast and forward moving development cycle.

# License
The reference Econode server and client implementations are licensed under the MIT license.
