# Econode
> üí∏ Terminal based idle incremental game.
Econode is an idle incremental game (think like Cookie Clicker,
or the [Cafe Discord bot](https://twitter.com/cafediscordbot?lang=en)) played in your
terminal.  

Compete with others in the Econetwork (Econode server) to have the highest earning Econode.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Econode is mostly in the concepting stage right now. Beware!
More info, and install instructions to setup an Econetwork will come soon.
